  <p> <b> Stretch, Spike, and Mustache Comb all met at college where they proceeded to form a band. Becoming friends first, they soon realized they had similar taste in music.
  Starting off as a joke, they created what soon became the masterpiece of the Neck Beards. The closer they became, the more this joke became a reality. Nicknames were created, and creative song titles were born.</b></p>

  <p > <b>Each member never actually thought they would truly become a band until one day they all were singing in the car together. There they realized that this silly little joke
  could actually become a reality. Mustache Comb already had experience playing instruments. Spike and Stretch had very little experience, but were eager to learn. The band so far has not released any music,
  or even a cover yet. But just you wait soon the Neck Beards will become the next big thing!</b></p>
